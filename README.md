- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analysis. Knowledge of Excel, PowerBI, QuickSight, Tableau and SQL. Trying to pick Pyhton. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (at least trying). For viz, I use QuickSight, but PowerBI and Tableau can also be a plus.
- 💞️ I’m looking to change careers on my late 40's. Yes, Data Analysis. Want to go there. I like to dig and find trends :P
- 📫 How to reach me -> just message me @ acaciojmartins@gmail.com (or if you work at amazon, you know how to find me ;) )
- 😄 Pronouns: He/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: Started learning SQL because in the team the only guy that knew, left. I was the only analyst who tried to learn alone. I am still the only guy in my team who knows SQL (and I am no analyst anymore. I mean...when needed)
